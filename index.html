                        Hello, my name is Jon Deaton. This is my personal website where you can find information about me
                        and some of the work, school, and projects that I have been a part of.
                        <br><br>
                        I am originally from Longmeadow, MA, and I was a competitive gymnast for 15 years. I did my
                        undergraduate studies at Stanford University in Bioengineering. At Stanford I also completed
                        premedical requirements with the intent of attending medical school and practicing medicine
                        as a physician. Through my study of bioengineering, I came to understand that through
                        that through engineering I could create larger impact on the fields of medicine and biology
                        than I could as a physician. I now aspire to use the combination of bioengineering and
                        computer science to advance biomedical engineering research.

                        Heat stroke kills thousands of people annually across the globe. The 2015 Indian heat wave,
                        for example, resulted in over 2,300 deaths over a two-month period. To address the need for
                        personalized heat stroke prevention in India, we created an inexpensive wearable device
                        that measures physiological and environmental
                        parameters and uses machine learning to determine and inform the user of heat stroke risk via
                        text message or cell phone application in real time. Our approach is novel because
                        we are using heat stroke patient data from literature to inform our algorithms and are
                        determining the parameters most indicative of heat stroke. We have developed a prediction
                        algorithm and are assembling relevant sensors and transmitting data. In the coming weeks,
                        we aim to finish these components and begin testing our system in a variety of high-risk
                        environments to assess accuracy by obtaining sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive
                        predictive value for our algorithm. We are working on a proof-of-concept prototype to
                        demonstrate viability of a heat stroke prediction device, though future versions would
                        leverage decreasing costs for wearable sensors with bluetooth capability.

                        Discovering novel phage sequences from metagenomic data is often challenging. This study
                        presents PhaMers (Phage k-Mers), a phage identification tool that uses supervised learning to
                        identify metagenomic sequences (contigs) as phage or non-phage on the basis of tetranucleotide
                        frequencies. PhaMers compares the tetranucleotide frequencies of metagenomic contigs to those
                        of phage and bacteria reference genomes from online databases. Using PhaMers, we identified
                        103 novel phage sequences in hot spring samples from Yellowstone National Park. We applied a
                        microfluidic-based mini-metagenomic approach to sequence environmental samples and
                        produce metagenomic sequence datasets. We analyzed assembled contigs using PhaMers and
                        VirSorter, a publicly available phage identification and annotation pipeline. We present the
                        performance of PhaMers in identifying genomic fragments of phages and its ability to predict
                        phage taxonomic classification. We also present putative hosts and taxa for some novel phage
                        sequences. PhaMers is available for public use at https://github.com/jondeaton/PhaMers.

                    <p>In BIOE 123, teams of 2-3 students design and build an E. Coli fermentor. The fermentor must hold a
                        culture of 200 mL, maintain a temperature of 37 ̊C ± 1 ̊C, provide adequate aeration and agitation, and
                        display live plots of optical density for red and green light. In addition, each team conceives of an
                        original requirement, that their fermentor must also meet. My team used a Raspberry Pi to allow remote
                        monitoring and control of our fermentor via Wi-Fi. This project was presented at the 2016 Tau Beta Pi
                        Engineering Showcase at Stanford University.

                        In the Quake Lab I worked on several molecular biology and bioinformatics research projects.
                        My molecular biology research has involved the design and debugging of novel molecular
                        biology protocols to analyze DNA. My experiments primarily involve extraction, purification,
                        amplification, and sequencing of RNA and DNA with and without microfluidic platforms.

                        For my honors thesis research I analyzed the frequencies of short DNA "words" with machine
                        learning algorithms to identify novel viral DNA sequences in metagenomic sequencing data.
                        I created a software tool in Python to accomplish this (github.com/jondeaton/PhaMers) and
                        discovered over 100 novel viral DNA sequences.

                        As an undergraduate I studied bioengineering and also completed premedical requirements. I took
                        5 years to gradaute as an undergraduate due to the large number of classes required for bioengineering
                        and premedicine that conflicted with practice times for gymnatics. In my study of bioengineering
                        I focused on the intersection of computer science and the biological sciences. Not only did I
                        take several computer science classes, but also my honors thesis and senior capstone projects
                        focused on the application of machine learning to solve biological and medical problems.

                        I was a member of the USA Junior National team for 5 years. To become a member of the national team
                        I placed within the top seven gymnastics of my age group at national championships.
                        Being on the national team earned me the opportunity to train at week-long training camps at
                        the USA Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, CO several times a year. This opportunity
                        also allowed me to represent the United States in three international competitions in
                        Lilleshall in the UK, Bejjing, China (left), and Medellín, Colombia.

                    <p>
                        During my undergraduate career at Stanford, I was a member of the Stanford Men's Gymnastics
                        Team for four years. For Stanford's team I competed all events but rings, and helped the
                        team to win two second place and one third place titles at the NCAA championships. Being a
                        gymnast on the Stanford Men's Gymnastics team required 20 hours of intensive training each
                        week in addition to weekly competitions across the country during the winter season. I was
                        a NCAA First Team Academic All-American at the 2013, 2014, and 2015 NCAA championships, and
                        an Elite 89 Scholar Athlete in 2014.

                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, during my senior year at Stanford, chronic injuries to my shoulders and ankles
                        from 15 years of intensive gymnastics prevented me from competing. Despite this, I remained
                        a contributing member of the team through a role as team manager.

                Of all the things I learned in gymnastics, my favorite by far was bouncing on the trampoline. I have
                a compilation of clips on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jony7779">YouTube</a> of me doing
                trampoline and some other things.
