# Jon Deaton's Webpage

Here I am adapting Hanes Stark's webpage at https://hannes-start.com/

It turns out, as far as I can tell, that Hannes' webpage doesn't just let me
download its contents.

So I'm going to try Gabriele's which actually is just based on
https://github.com/msaveski/www_personal


Some other good templates:
